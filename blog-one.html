                “THE WHOLE SYSTEM is totally fucked,” says Peter Cole, owner of Australian
                ecommerce company Urban Plant
                Growers. Two months after it was due to arrive in Sydney, Cole’s $1.6 million order of hydroponic kits
                and
                lights, packed into two 40-foot shipping containers aboard a ship that set sail from Shenzhen, China, is
                still floating somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.

                <p>It never used to be this way. In the before times, Cole’s kit was manufactured, shipped, and ready to
                    sell
                    to his customers in a little over six weeks. Then everything broke down.
                </p>

                <p>Cole isn’t alone. A perfect storm of global issues have combined to break the just-in-time supply
                    chains
                    that keep the world going. From the Ever Given getting stuck in the Suez Canal to Covid-19 changing
                    the
                    way
                    we shop, the world is also contending with China’s rapid shift away from coal power. In response, a
                    system
                    that used to run relatively smoothly is now in tatters. “Any one of the issues that led to this
                    would
                    have
                    caused problems,” says Enda Breslin of ShipBob, a global fulfillment firm. “But all of them put
                    together
                    have caused these massive issues we’re hearing about right now.” The ramifications are enormous,
                    from
                    spiking prices for Christmas presents to a run on Black Friday bargains, empty supermarket shelves,
                    nonexistent car sales, and a frantic grab for the shipping containers usually used to pack and send
                    items
                    around the globe.
                </p>

                <p>The issues knocking the supply chain out of kilter runs the gamut from enormous government
                    interventions
                    to
                    the global pandemic shutting ports. But the best place to start, says Marc Levinson—author of two
                    books
                    on
                    shipping containers—is with politicians. “We had governments all over the world stimulating
                    consumption
                    in
                    the face of the pandemic,” he says. The UK, for example, set out a package of economic stimuluses in
                    the
                    summer of 2020 that was specifically designed to get people shopping on high streets. In the US,
                    stimulus
                    checks sent directly to citizens resulted in sa 4.2 percent month-on-month increase in consumer
                    spending
                    in
                    March 2021. We’ve also been encouraged to spend our money online, requiring a rapid retooling of the
                    way
                    that businesses work. For decades, the retail industry’s reliance on shipping has had what Breslin
                    calls
                    “a
                    beautiful stability”: Retail grew 2 percent every year; retailers would publish two catalogs of new
                    products
                    every 12 months, allowing stores to buy their stock in advance. “There was no resilience built into
                    the
                    system,” says Breslin. “That complacency was borne out of years of success.”
