                For years, electric bicycles were bulky, inconvenient, expensive machines with limited battery life.
                Slowly, that has changed. Ebikes are now lighter, more attractive, and more powerful than ever. You
                don't need to be physically fit to ride one. They get you outside, reduce traffic congestion, and shrink
                your carbon footprint. And they're fun!
            </p>

            <p>Over the past few years, my fellow Gear writers and I have tried almost every kind of electric bike, from
                the best heavy-duty cargo bikes to high-end mountain bikes. We're always testing new ones, so if you
                don't see what you want, check back later (or drop me a note!). And once you buy an ebike, check out our
                favorite biking accessories, bike locks, and gear for a bikepacking adventure.
